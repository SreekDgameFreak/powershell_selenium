Info
----


Clone of [Pre-Release 1.3](https://github.com/phaufe/screentogif)
of 
[https://screentogif.codeplex.com/](https://github.com/phaufe/screentogif),
intended to extract ScreeToGif.Legacy.RecordPause into a Selenium extension utility for enabling screen recording of failed tests. Intended to use together with e.g.
[NUnitRetryOnException`](https://github.com/stevegray12/NUnitRetryOnException)

Note
----
The legacy release was chosen to start with because the UI does not require C# 6 to compile.
