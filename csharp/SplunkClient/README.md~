Console app that demostrates logging to Splunk. 

Note

Building example
----------------

The Splunk Client SDK is only available through Nuget as a Windows Phone 8.1 assembly(!) compiled for .Net 4.5.1. 

The alternative is to compile Splunk Client SDK  from source for Net 4.5 and use the locally build assembly to run examples. This may eventually allow one to have Spunk Client in plain Powershell examples.


To avoid forking the full Splunk Client repo, one have to get the original zip and apply a patch to various csproj files. The patch:

   * Downgrades from MS Build 2013 to MS Build 2010
   * Downgrades from .Net 4.5.1 to .Net 4.5
   * Uncomments the implementaion of to avoid [An assembly (probably "<my project>") must be rewritten using the code contracts binary rewriter...](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24729398/code-contracts-support-in-visual-studio-express-2013) runtime error.
